# Privacy Policy
## Collected data
Birthday Bot collects some of your data. In order to function, these are the things that are collected and stored indefinitely:
- Anything you provide to the bot through commands. This primarily includes birthday details and configuration data
- Discord-provided server, user, channel, and role IDs, as part of saving birthdays and configuring pings/channels
- Daily backups of the above

## Storage and access
Data is stored using PostgreSQL on a secure and private server. The data is only accessible by the developers of the bot; no one else has been given access.

## Usage
Data collected by the bot is used in a few ways:
### Server IDs
Server IDs are used to differentiate birthdays saved across servers, as well as to store server-specific configuration.

### User IDs
User IDs are used to differentiate birthdays between users in a server, and allow users to edit those birthdays

### Role IDs
Role IDs are stored to keep track of roles that are meant to be pinged, which can be set up through commands.

### Text provided through commands
Some other data may be stored through commands, such as names associated with birthdays. This is used to differentiate and edit those birthdays.

## Removing data
Most data can easily be deleted by using the proper command to delete it. Note that this will not remove data from any existing backups of it, and that it is still possible to lose access to some data by leaving servers or removing the bot from your server.  
If you would like inaccessible data deleted, feel free to contact us using the information below.

## Contact
If desired, you can contact us at (GS)#6969 on Discord or [join the support server](https://discord.gg/EvDmXGt) to ask us to remove any other data. This is also where we can be contacted about privacy concerns if necessary.
