# Birthday Bot
*A PluralKit and Tupperbox compatible Discord bot for birthday reminders*

Birthday Bot is a simple and easy-to-use bot built to make birthday reminders easier, especially for plural folks.
With the ability to import birthdays from PK and Tbox, it's now far easier to handle birthday reminders for your system!

BB's reminders and birthdays are per-server, allowing you to decide which birthdays you want public and which ones you'd rather keep private.
You can also export and import birthdays you have saved in the bot, allowing you to add your birthdays to multiple servers after setting them up in just one.
On top of that, there are commands to view upcoming and recent birthdays, giving you the opportunity to hand out those belated birthday wishes ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽŠ

# Setup
## Invite
You can invite the bot using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1010708152079106149&permissions=134144&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Setting up reminders
You can use `/channel` to set the channel for birthday reminders. At a set time every day, the bot will post in this channel and list all the birthdays for that day!

You can also use `/pings` to set up who should get pinged for birthdays. The options are for @/everyone, a specific role, or for just the users who are having
birthdays on that day

## Adding birthdays
### Importing
You can also use `/import` to import birthdays from PK and Tbox! The bot will look for tups/members that have birthdays set and then import them from there,
setting them up with the names used in the PK/Tbox file. This is the easiest way to set up your birthdays

### Manual
You can use `/add` to add a new birthday manually. This will prompt you for a name and a date (in MM-DD) format, and will add it to your list of birthdays for the server

## That's it!
You should now have birthdays set up in the bot, and you'll see a reminder whenever one of your birthdays hits!
